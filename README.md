# Swapi

An IOS app that displays a set of all the People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets from **Star Wars** movies.

This is the early development stage of Swapi. So, it is far from finished. :blush:

API and back end service are already written and credit to https://github.com/phalt/swapi, which was developed by

* Paul Hallett
* Owen Hallett
* Carvilsi
* Andrea Stagi

# Design Patter

This app currently uses Clean IOS and ViewModel architecture. It also contains SwapiUiTests.swfit and SwapiTests.swift for continous integration

# Contribution

Since this is the early stage. All contributions are more than welcomed.
